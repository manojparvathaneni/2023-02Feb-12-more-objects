    "\n",
    "In Jupyter, we have some things we call \"magic commands.\" These are commands that aren't passed to Python, but rather are passed to Jupyter. They all start with `%`, because that's not a legal character in Python function and variable names.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It's true that in my online courses, I've been telling people to say `%pylab inline`, because that was a really easy way to do things... I recently discovered that this is now deprecated, and you should instead say `%matplotlib inline`.\n",
